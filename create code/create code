//move forward a little (10 cm maybe)
//move backwards (10 cm^^)
//turn left 135 degrees
//15-30 seconds
//close scoop
//raise scoop (high enough to reach below alarm switch)
//move to alarm (use variable “alarmdistance”)
//raise scoop to switch the alarm
//move backwards (“alarmdistance”)
//turn right 45 degrees
//lower scoop (able to pick up cube)
//open scoop (enough to pick up cube)
//move to red cube
//30-45 seconds
